----------------------- Starter code for your B-Tree -----------------------

Helpful Tips (You will need these):
1. Your tree should be composed of BTreeNode objects, where each node has:
    - the disk block address of its parent node
    - the disk block addresses of its children nodes (if non-leaf)
    - the data items inside (if leaf)
    - a flag indicating whether it is a leaf

------------- THE ONLY DATA STORED IN THE `BTree` OBJECT SHOULD BE THE `M` & `L` VALUES AND THE ADDRESS OF THE ROOT NODE -------------
-------------              THIS IS BECAUSE THE POINT IS TO STORE THE ENTIRE TREE ON DISK AT ALL TIMES                    -------------

2. Create helper methods:
    - get a node's parent with DISK.read(parent_address)
    - get a node's children with DISK.read(child_address)
    - write a node back to disk with DISK.write(self)
    - check the health of your tree (makes debugging a piece of cake)
        - go through the entire tree recursively and check that children point to their parents, etc.
        - now call this method after every insertion in your testing and you will find out where things are going wrong
3. Don't fall for these common bugs:
    - Forgetting to update a node's parent address when its parent splits
        - Remember that when a node splits, some of its children no longer have the same parent
    - Forgetting that the leaf and the root are edge cases
    - FORGETTING TO WRITE BACK TO THE DISK AFTER MODIFYING / CREATING A NODE
    - Forgetting to test odd / even M values
    - Forgetting to update the KEYS of a node who just gained a child
    - Forgetting to redistribute keys or children of a node who just split
    - Nesting nodes inside of each other instead of using disk addresses to reference them
        - This may seem to work but will fail our grader's stress tests
4. USE THE DEBUGGER
5. USE ASSERT STATEMENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
    - e.g. `assert node.parent != None or node == self.root` <- if this fails, something is very wrong

--------------------------- BEST OF LUCK ---------------------------

        It will probably be useful to have an internal
        _find_node() method that searches for the node
        that should be our parent (or finds the leaf
        if the key is already present).

        Overwrite old values if the key exists in the BTree.

        Make sure to write back all changes to the disk!

        This should be implemented with a logarithmic search

        BTreeNode.find_idx() method for an example of using
        the builtin bisect library to search for a number in 
        a sorted array in logarithmic time.
